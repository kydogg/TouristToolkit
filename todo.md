1. refactor the project

- have destinations be a seperate list of entitites within the code, GPT to make sure that there is a large list of destinations
- needs to be a terminal app that the user will be able to enter in input for as well
- rework the return statement of `get_attractions_for_traveler()` so that the output has a bulleted list.
